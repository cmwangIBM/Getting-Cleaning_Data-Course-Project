==========================================

This repo hosts the R code and documentation files for the course project for
"Getting and Cleaning data” as a Coursera course work.

The dataset being used and the description of the experiment can be found at:

Files
-----

In addition to this README.md file, there are 3 other files submitted as a part
of this analysis.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data sets, and any transformations or
work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the code used to perform the analyses described in the
5 steps asked by the instructors:

1.  Merges training and test sets to create one data set.

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement.

3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activites in the data set.

4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of the 5th step is `averages_data.txt`.
